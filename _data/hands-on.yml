  title: "Learn Git and Github by writing a Git guide on Github"
  description: >
    Github is a useful, flexible collaboration tool that can be used for a wide variety of projects, not just code.
    In this session, we will practice using Github and review Git concepts at the same time by fixing an incomplete
    Git guide on Github. You will take turns being contributors and maintainers. Bonus points if you go all out and
    use Git to interact with Github to write about Git.

    installing Git and using Git to interact with the repository is highly recommended.

  title: "Code testing steps, tools, and tips"
  description: >
    No matter which language your programming depends on, bugs inevitably exist even for experienced coders. Simply
    running the code to completion does not guarantee it has no bugs. This makes code testing very necessary and
    important. In this session, we will go through key steps of code testing, potential tools, and some tips for
    efficient debugging/programming. You will be assigned into small groups to practice on some scenarios by testing
    Python code.

    Almost all researchers have data and analysis scripts that generate results in the form of figures. Yet, few other
    researchers can use these exact data and scripts to generate the same figures, or to reproduce all results of the
    study. In this session, we’ll take you on a journey of building reproducible workflows that help alleviate the
    anxiety associated with receiving that dreaded email 'I’d like to reproduce your results...' We’ll start with
    helping others run your code on their machines, and end up with a fully reproducible workflow running in the cloud,
    with several pit stops in between.

  title: "Introduction to Neuroimaging Data Visualization in R"
  description: >
    This short interactive workshop will introduce the basics of visualizing neuroimaging data in R  and introduce you
    to some of the packages available in R. First, we will cover the principles of reproducible and programmatic data
    visualizations. We will then work through an R notebook where you will learn how to load, view, and run basic
    manipulations on Nifti images within R. We will also cover visualizing ROI- and vertex-level data, as well as
    edge-level brain network visualizations.

  title: "Machine learning and Data Visualization with Python"
  description: >
    In this session, we will delve into using the Python programming language to fit various machine learning models on
    a sample neuroimaging dataset. We'll be using tools from numpy, pandas, and sklearn packages to read the input data,
    modify it and extract informative knowledge using the machine learning models. Thereafter, we'll use the
    visualization tools at our disposal to make sense of the fitted models. These visualizations can come in handy for
    translating our findings into a clarified visualization that summarizes the conclusions in a figure. While an
    elementary knowledge of the python programming language or familiarity with programming languages in general is
    anticipated, you are not required to have any tools installed to attend this session. We'll conduct all of our
    analysis on the cloud and in a simple step-by-step tutorial that can assist individuals who are new to programming.

    raw data using methods of machine learning and data visualization."

    The Community Building workshop will be led by Jivesh Ramduny (@JRamduny) and Marta Topor (@MartaTopor) to introduce
    the importance of establishing an Open Science community with regards to the issues that surrounds the
    reproducibility crisis in research. The workshop will allow participants at all career stages to brainstorm about
    ideas that are fundamental to facilitate different community activities in addition to fostering an Open Science
    culture in academia via short- and long-term credible and collaborative projects. The workshop will also provide a
    practical section to allow participants to start planning their own community activities in an effort to help them
    start an Open Science community at their institutions or within their networks.
