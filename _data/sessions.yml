  long_description: >
    The session is tailored to a person, who starts their first project using matlab. First, it will
    include a brief introduction to good coding practices highlighting that matlab can also be used
    to share code. Then I’ll give some general matlab coding tips with some examples and will go
    line-by-line through some old 'inherited' code demonstrating what’s wrong with it and showing an
    example of how it can be re-written in a more usable way. After, I’ll outline how to share the
    code on github, what should be included in the documentation, so the code can be easily used by others.
    At the end, there will be a task to create a couple of functions (to plot provided data), make a
    github repository and give documentation on github.

    The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) is seeing widespread adoption as a standard for data
    organization, data sharing, and automated processing. This TrainTrack session provides an
    introduction to the organizational principles of BIDS with examples from the fMRI literature.
    We’ll touch on the expanding BIDS ecosystem (BIDS derivatives and extensions), as well as tools
    for facilitating BIDS conversion and data sharing. Finally, we’ll discuss automated processing
    workflows that capitalize on BIDS—i.e. BIDS Apps—for fMRI quality control (MRIQC) and
    preprocessing (fMRIPrep).

    A beautiful visualization is not just a good-looking piece of graph, chart, or colored brain.
    It is an informative and efficient way to represent our data and results, which follows the scientific
    principles (e.g. honesty truth, consistency etc.). A compelling visualization is essential to organize
    the data, display the results, communicate the information, as well as change the way we perceive the world.
    The Brain Art special interest group  will walk you through the basics, share the skills of brain visualization,
    and make the brain visualization novel, creative, aesthetic and fun to the community.

                INCF supports open science working groups and groups that provide training on open science practices.
                Since 2013, INCF has supported OHBM’s open science efforts; yet there has been little crossover between
                OHBM’s open science community and INCF. The purpose of this session is to present INCF’s open science
                efforts and discuss how the OHBM community can support the open science efforts of INCF, what resources/services
                INCF should offer in order to maximize the efforts of the community, and why an open science practitioner or
                advocate would choose or not choose to become a member and support such an organization such as INCF."
