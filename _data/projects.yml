#   image: matrix.png
#   details: "C-MARINeR is a focused sub-project MARINeR: Multivariate Analysis and Resampling Inference
#     for Neuroimaging in R. The C stands generally for connectivity, but specifically and statistically:
#     covariance or correlation. The C-MARINeR project aims to develop and distribute an R package and
#     ShinyApp. Together, R + Shiny allows for ease of use and, hopefully, simpler exploration of such
#     complex data, and quicker adoption of the techniques. <br> More info here:

#   title: "Bring your own method/data"
#   image: whatever.png
#   details: "The three methods suggested above are just a starting point. If a group of participants wants to work
#     on something else, this is of course possible. We have also prepare some data to use the methods above,
#     but if you have your own data, please bring it with you and try to hack it with the methods presented."

  title: "NeuroDesk - A scalable and easy to use data analysis environment for reproducible neuroimaging"
  image: neurodesk.jpg
  details: "Neuroimaging researchers require a diverse collection of bespoke command-line and graphical tools
  to analyse data and answer research questions. Installing and maintaining a neuroimaging software setup is
  challenging and often results in un-reproducible environments. Container technology, such as docker or singularity, enables the execution of software
  on different operating systems and could aid in distributing scientific software. We are developing NeuroDesk, a
  platform build on container technology for processing and analysing neuroimaging data with the aim to lower the
  barrier of using various neuroimaging software in a reproducible environment, so that researchers spend less time on
  setting up and maintaining an analysis environment.<br>

  title: "Brain QR Modem - A setup to stream MRI images unidirectionally to the cloud via QR code animations"
  image: qrmodem.gif
  details: "Have you ever been annoyed how hard it is to get brain data off the scanner? The fact that scanners usually
  contain private information about patients and are thus embedded in maximally restrictive clinical cyber-security
  environments, makes it quite complicated to get access to the data. Especially when visiting collaborative sites.
  In this Hackathon project, we aim to develop a purely uni-directional (safe) data streaming ‚Äúhack‚Äù to transfer MRI
  data directly to the cloud by means dynamic QR codes. In the early days of the Internet, modems
  (modulator-demodulator) were used to (i) convert digital information into audio streams, (ii) transfer them across
  telephone lines, and (iii) convert them back into the digital domain. Here, we aim to do the same thing with pixel
  data of MRI scans. However, instead of audio signal we will use machine-readable visual information: QR codes.<br>

  title: "Flooding brains: Mesmerizing & relaxing volumetric brain animations"
  image: flooding.gif
  details: "After üéÜ exploding brains üéÜ in the last year's brainhack, now it is time for animations of a more relaxing
  sort. I will be mainly using a few LayNii programs that I have been developing for high resolution imaging over the
  last year (e.g. layers, columns) to generate mesmerizing brain animations. I will focus on using animal brains from
  one of my favorite projects: https://braincatalogue.org/.<br>

  details: "An extension proposal that has been in the works for a while, and builds upon the original BIDS Apps paper,
  this extension seeks to further standardize the execution specification for BIDS applications, including integration
  with Boutiques.<br>

  title: "Phys2BIDScoin: Integrating BIDScoin and phys2bids for a user-friendly GUI based BIDS conversion of physiological files"
  image: BIDScoin.png
  details: "Phys2bids is a python3 toolkit meant to format physiological files in BIDS. BIDScoin is also a python3 toolkit 
  that is meant to format MRI source files in BIDS. BIDScoin comes with a data discovery routine and a graphical interface 
  to customize the formatting heuristics. The actual data discovery and formatting is done using plugins and the BIDScoin
  framework itself is agnostic about the source modality. Phys2bids currently lacks data discovery functionality and 
  BIDScoin lacks a formatting backend for physiological data. The goal of this project is to develop the plugin interface
  between BIDScoin and phys2bids and hence combine their complementary functionality for both projects.<br>

  title: "Physiological signal classification challenge"
  image: physiopy.png
  details: "Phys2bids is a python3 library to format physiological files in BIDS. One of the current development goals is 
  to make phys2bids smarter by implementing an automatic signal classificator. Ideally, given a physiological signal as 
  input, phys2bids should be able to determine the type of the signal (cardiac, respiratory ‚Ä¶).<br><br>
  To move forward, this project is structured as a challenge: we provide time-series data of 4 kinds of physiological 
  signals (cardiac, respiratory_chest, O2 and CO2) and the goal will be to collaborate to find robust features that 
  allow discerning between them.<br>

  Currently, the book contains companion material of the paper, but we are looking forward to hear what other content
  the community want it to have. Join the discussion!<br>

  title: "ARTEM-IS web app: working towards an Agreed Reporting Template for EEG Methodology (International Standard)"
  image: ARTEM-IS.png
  details: "The dense data streams and analytical flexibility of electroencephalography (EEG), result in a substantial
  ‚ÄòGarden of Forking Paths‚Äô. Recent research (<a href=https://psyarxiv.com/jp6wy>≈†o≈°kiƒá et al 2021</a>) shows that most research reports do not contain
  sufficient detail in their methods to know which path has been taken, hampering reproducibility, replication and meta-science.
  Our initiative to create an Agreed Reporting Template for an International Standard (<a href=https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/PDX6Y>ARTEM-IS</a>) includes
  a draft template designed to make reporting EEG methodology easier and more accurate, by providing fields for researchers 
  to input specific methodological details. Read more about why we need this tool and how you can help 
  to make it better in our (<a href=https://psyarxiv.com/myn7t>preprint</a>).<br>

  title: "The courtois-neuromod physiological data as a use-case for phys2bids"
  image: cneuromod.svg
  details: "Phys2bids provides a way to convert physiological recording files to bids format. This brainhack project acts
  as user testing for the software by applying its workflow to a large-scale dataset. The Courtois Neuromod project is 
  a longitudinal program which collects massive amounts of multimodal data (neuroimaging, peripheral physiologicals signal
  and eye-tracking) with the same 6 subjects throughout different tasks. We want to apply the phys2bids workflow 
  to the entire physiological signals (electrocardiographic, electrodermal, respiration and pulse) dataset.<br>
