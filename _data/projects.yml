#   title: "Multi-table PCA methods for group and individual functional connectivity"
#   image: matrix.png
#   details: "C-MARINeR is a focused sub-project MARINeR: Multivariate Analysis and Resampling Inference
#     for Neuroimaging in R. The C stands generally for connectivity, but specifically and statistically:
#     covariance or correlation. The C-MARINeR project aims to develop and distribute an R package and
#     ShinyApp. Together, R + Shiny allows for ease of use and, hopefully, simpler exploration of such
#     complex data, and quicker adoption of the techniques. <br> More info here:

#   title: "Bring your own method/data"
#   image: whatever.png
#   details: "The three methods suggested above are just a starting point. If a group of participants wants to work
#     on something else, this is of course possible. We have also prepare some data to use the methods above,
#     but if you have your own data, please bring it with you and try to hack it with the methods presented."

  title: "Learn and Enhance BrainIAK Tutorials: From Basics to Advanced fMRI Analyses"

  details: "Neuroimaging researchers require a diverse collection of bespoke command-line and graphical tools
  to analyse data and answer research questions. Installing and maintaining a neuroimaging software setup is
  challenging and often results in un-reproducible environments. Container technology, such as docker or singularity, enables the execution of software
  on different operating systems and could aid in distributing scientific software. We are developing NeuroDesk, a
  platform build on container technology for processing and analysing neuroimaging data with the aim to lower the
  barrier of using various neuroimaging software in a reproducible environment, so that researchers spend less time on
  setting up and maintaining an analysis environment.<br>

  title: "Brain QR Modem - A setup to stream MRI images unidirectionally to the cloud via QR code animations"
  image: qrmodem.gif
  details: "Have you ever been annoyed how hard it is to get brain data off the scanner? The fact that scanners usually
  contain private information about patients and are thus embedded in maximally restrictive clinical cyber-security
  environments, makes it quite complicated to get access to the data. Especially when visiting collaborative sites.
  In this Hackathon project, we aim to develop a purely uni-directional (safe) data streaming ‚Äúhack‚Äù to transfer MRI
  data directly to the cloud by means dynamic QR codes. In the early days of the Internet, modems
  (modulator-demodulator) were used to (i) convert digital information into audio streams, (ii) transfer them across
  telephone lines, and (iii) convert them back into the digital domain. Here, we aim to do the same thing with pixel
  data of MRI scans. However, instead of audio signal we will use machine-readable visual information: QR codes.<br>

  title: "Flooding brains: Mesmerizing & relaxing volumetric brain animations"
  image: flooding.gif
  details: "After üéÜ exploding brains üéÜ in the last year's brainhack, now it is time for animations of a more relaxing
  sort. I will be mainly using a few LayNii programs that I have been developing for high resolution imaging over the
  last year (e.g. layers, columns) to generate mesmerizing brain animations. I will focus on using animal brains from
  one of my favorite projects: https://braincatalogue.org/.<br>

  details: "An extension proposal that has been in the works for a while, and builds upon the original BIDS Apps paper,
  this extension seeks to further standardize the execution specification for BIDS applications, including integration
  with Boutiques.<br>
