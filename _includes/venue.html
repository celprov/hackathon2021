                <p>For the second year in a row, all the events organized by the Open-Science Special Interest Group
                    of OHBM will be virtual. Once it was time to pick an image for homepage, rather than coming up with
                    a picture of a <em>virtual brain</em>, we thought it would be interesting to <em>compose</em> a brain
                    with what is the actual venue for each of us: our desk.</p>

                <p>We asked to colleagues and on Mattermost for pictures of desks. Then, using a picture of an
                    <em>ex vivo</em> brain (the original picture is part of figure 3a in
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-69163-z">this paper</a>)
                    as a template, we created the photo mosaic brain in the homepage</p>

                <p>We would very much like for every brainhack attendee to add to this page a
                    picture of their desk (be aware that it doesn't have to be an actual desk :) if you are lucky enough,
                    a beach towel may be your desk!).</p>

                <p>
                  To do that you can follow the instruction
                    <a href="https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2021/blob/main/.github/venue_contribution.md" target="_blank">here</a>
                    to guide you on how to make a pull request to this repository to add your image.</p>
