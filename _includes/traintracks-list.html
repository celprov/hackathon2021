                <h6>
                    The <b>TrainTrack</b> is the <b>educational side</b> of a <b>Brainhack</b> event, and it is the
                    right place for everyone  to learn about open science and some important skills for developing
                    in open science.<br><br>
                    This year we want to make the TrainTrack a <i>multimodal</i> experience.
                    For many newcomers (but also oldcomers) looking for learning about the latest tools
                    for <i>brainhacking</i>, we want to make this chance the perfect one to really dive in!<br>
                    The TrainTrack is structured in three layers:<br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="#prerecorded">mini lectures</a>: to make the most of a virtual event, we want to maximize
                            interactivity; we believe that everyone can take advantage of any pre-recorded videos
                            and watch them whenever it is feasible, to spend the time during the hackathon
                            interacting with other participants;</li><br>
                        <li><a href="#brainart">amazing BrainArt tutorials</a>: once again we joined forces with the
                            <a href="https://ohbm-brainart.github.io" target="_blank">BrainArt SIG</a>! This year they
                            have pre-recorded tutorials that you can watch whenever you would like
                            and there will be live sessions with the speakers!</li><br>
                        <li><b>live Q&A sessions</b>: it does not matter if a topic is new or already known,
                            there is always something to learn when discussing with each other; check the
                            <a href="../schedule">schedule</a> to see when they are going live!</li><br>
                        <li><a href="#handson">hands-on sessions</a>: we believe that learning by doing is invaluable; that is why
                            this year we are organizing hands-on sessions, profoundly inspired from
                            <a href="https://www.neuromatchacademy.org" target="_blank">NeuroMatch Academy</a> and
                            linked to the <a href="https://ossig.netlify.app/awards/" target="_blank">Open Science
                                SIG Fellows</a> initiative.</li>

            <h6 style="text-align: justify;">We collected videos from many of the amazing virtual events from the past
                year and put together a playlist to prepare for the hackathon! The videos cover six general topics:
                version control; code testing; reproducible workflows; data visualization; machine learning;
                community building.</h6><br>

            <h6 style="text-align: justify;">Learn by doing always feels like something special - this is why this year
                we put together a series of hands-on sessions. These sessions need small groups to allow everyone to
                <em>get their hands dirty</em>, and since we have a limited number of fellows to lead them we are
                collecting expression of interest to register - we will confirm the registration for every form
                submitted. If you are interested in multiple topics, you can submit multiple forms, but take into
                account that we will aim at giving the chance to participate to as more people as we can. You can find
                the form <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/qysZYQgjHb" target="_blank">here</a>.
