# Project Monitor: role description

The [OHBM Brainhack 2021](https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2021/) will gather researchers throughout the world for an online hackathon June 16-18.

**Project monitors** play an essential role in guiding project leads to comply with Brainhack project guidelines and set minimal documentation to make their project more welcoming to new members.

## Description ##
A monitor is a member of the open science neuroimaging community who:
 - is familair with general flow of the Brainhack;
 - understands the roles and responsibilities of the monitor as outlined in this document and the [Project Monitor Guideline](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2021/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/handbooks/monitor_guideline.md);
 - is familiar with online tools for collaborative projects: including [mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org)<!-- TODO: identify platform(s) -->;
 - feels comfortable welcoming project leads and sharing information on how to use these tools as needed.

As a monitor, there is no need for you to have expertise in the project you are assigned to.

## Expectations ##
- Help develop and maintain a welcoming environment in the OHBM Brainhack.
- Reviewing project(s) assigned to you or that you have chosen
- Conveying a continuous communication with the project leaders and members throughout the Brainhack
- If you would like, share your thoughts/advice on the methodological, technological and theoretical aspects of the projects.
   - Help them to find and contact the experts from the community in the case of queries.  
   - Direct them to related Brainhack sources/tools to use/read.
   - Check that there is no conflict or violation of CoC occuring among the project members.
<!-- 6. Jointly with the team of project monitors, help identify possible merges across projects and hubs. We would like to target a total of 20-25 projects per hub maximum to keep project pitches under 1.5 hours. -->
<!-- 7. Once projects have been approved, help advertise them on the website and social media in relation with the communication team. -->
<!-- 8. During the Brainhack, interact daily with the project lead on Github to 1- get feedback on the event, 2- document progress and 3- gather any feedback or specific need for help regarding the project. Communicate feedback or any identified issues with hub leads as needed. -->

- **Estimated time**: max 30 minutes per project during project submission and max 15 minutes per project / day during Brainhack.
