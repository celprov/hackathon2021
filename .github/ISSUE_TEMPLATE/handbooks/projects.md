# OHBM Brainhack 2020 Project handbook

## Project submission

You can then submit a project [here](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/issues/new/choose).

We will ask you to provide some information about your project in order to advertise it and help onboarding new members.

If you have any questions on the way of submitting your project, a dedicated project advisor will be here to guide you.

In order to keep things to a manageable size, we hope to limit the number of projects to maximum 25 per hub. If the topic of your submitted project is close to another submission, your project advisor might recommend that you consider creating a joint project.

This handbook includes more information on each item.

### Timezone

The OHBM Brainhack 2020 will run across 3 hubs and each hub will cover multiple timezones. We ask you to include the [UTC offset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC_offset) of your time zone.

### Link to project

If your project involves code we recommend using a GitHub or GitLab repository.

If your project does not involve coding, please include a link to the relevant documentation
(e.g. shared online document, space on the open science framework, etc.).

[YourRepo](_insert_URL_here) with a [README.md](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/write-a-great-project-readme/) containing:
-   project idea and context;
-   installation guidelines if applicable;
-   links to further reading/tutorials;
-   and if you want, additional files such as [Contributors.md](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/write-contributor-guidelines/), to specify which types of people can contribute how.

### Goals

Try to describe what you want to achieve during this brainhack.

If your project is just starting it might simply be "discuss, set up a roadmap, and identify potential obstacles".

For some other projects it could be a set of **SMART** goals:
-   Specific (simple, sensible, significant).
-   Measurable (meaningful, motivating).
-   Achievable (agreed, attainable).
-   Relevant (reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based).
-   Time bound (time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely, time-sensitive).

If you have set up a repository for your code, we will ask you to open at least 2 `good first issues`
issues that describe the goals you would like to achieve in this brainhack.

Some examples:
-   implement a new feature for a package
-   create a tutorial for a package
-   make a Python version of your Matlab based toolbox
-   come up with a prototype of a standardized consent form that can be used by different labs
-   create a fantastic list of neuroscience resources that will help generations of young researchers to come

### Onboarding: 2 good first issues

Flesh out at least 2 "good first issues": those are tasks that do not require any prior knowledge about your project, could be defined as issues in a GitHub repository, or in a shared document.

#### Set up a kanban board

To keep track of the progress on the 2 issues of your project and all the sub-tasks this might involve you
can use a kanban board.

A kanban board helps you manage your work in a very visual way: here is a short [video explaining the
idea](https://www.digite.com/kanban/what-is-kanban/).

You can use the integrated kanban on [GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-project-boards) or use an external app like [trello](https://trello.com/).

### Onboarding: skills

List skills that would be particularly suitable for your project. We ask you to include at least one non-coding skill.

#### Non-coding skills

Think in particular about what different types of contributions could be?

It is not all about coding! Are you interested in collaborating with someone with a good flair for
good visualization? Someone with more experience who can make a good user interface? Someone who
knows how to develop good, tidy and clear documentation?

### Communication

#### Chat

Add a link to the communication channel for your project.

You can, for example, create a mattermost channel for your project inside the
[brainhack mattermost](https://mattermost.brainhack.org/), and include a mattermost badge
<a href="https://mattermost.brainhack.org/">
  <img src="http://www.mattermost.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/logoHorizontal.png" width=100px>
</a> to invite people to the brainhack mattermost, where they can then find and join your channel.

If you already have a [slack]() workspace or are using [gitter]() or [discord]() or any other platform
to communicate for your project, just mention it here.

#### Video calls

To facilitate coordination we suggest you set up a [jitsi room](https://meet.jit.si/) or use
zoom / [a permanent skype group](https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34799/how-do-i-create-a-group-chat-in-skype-on-desktop) /
google hangouts or some similar service so you can interact live with all project members wherever they are.

### Participant capacity

As a project leader it is important that you do not overstretch yourself.
Try to estimate the maximum number of people you would be comfortable having on your team.

### Credit and onboarding

How would your project onboard new members with different skillsets -- physicist/imager/clinician/psychologist/computational
scientist/maker/artist/lawyer -- as a project collaborator?

We recommend that you read through Mozilla Open Leadership material on
[personas](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/bring-on-contributors-using-personas-and-pathways/) and [contribution guidelines](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/write-contributor-guidelines/).

If you want to easily list contributors on your repository you can look into the [all contributors bot](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors-bot).

## Project kick-off

After the project kick-off, we ask you to add the following information to your project on GitHub:

### Suggested meeting time
We would like you to plan one daily video meetings with your team members.

Choose a time that will suit the majority of project members (there might be multiple timezones).


### Twitter-size summary of your project pitch
During the project pitch session, we will tweet about yout project. Our default tweet will be as follows:

```
Title
Repo URL
Project leader Twitter handle
#OHBMHackathon #Brainhack #OHBM2020
```

Please provide a twitter-sized summary of your project if you would like us to tweet that insteas of title.

### Project snippet for the OHBM Brainhack website

If you want to help us list your project on the hackathon website, you can paste your `PROJECT TITLE`
and `PROJECT DESCRIPTION` and the `ISSUE_NUMBER`of your project in the snippet of code below. You can
also provide an image for your project.

If you want you can then open a pull-request to add this code in the
[`_data/projects.yml`](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/_data/projects.yml)
file. If you have no idea how to do this, don't worry: we are here
to help.

If you want to add an image to illustrate your project it should go in the
[`img/hackathon`](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/tree/master/img/hackathon) folder.
If you don't have any image you can use `whatever.png`.


```
 -
   title: "PROJECT TITLE"
   image: IMAGE_FILENAME
   details: "PROJECT DESCRIPTION.
   <br>More information <a href=https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/issues/ISSUE_NUMBER>in this github issue</a>"
