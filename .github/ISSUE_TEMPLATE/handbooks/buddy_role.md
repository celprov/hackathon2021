# Brainhack buddy: role description

The [OHBM Brainhack 2021](https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2021/) will gather researchers throughout
the world for an online hackathon June 16-18, organized around two main time slots (1AM-6AM UTC and 2PM-7PM UTC).

*You have already attended a brainhack and are keen on welcoming new members in the Brainhack community?
 Sign up as a **Brainhack buddy**! You will be paired with an attendee who is coming to their first
 hackathon. You will spend 1-hour a day with them to help with their onboarding.* Detailed info below.

**Brainhack buddies** play an essential role in onboarding attendees who join a hackathon for the first time.

#### Description

Each new comer (never attended a Brainhack before) will have the opportunity to  be paired with a
buddy (that has already attended at least one Brainhack). They will receive information ahead of
the hackathon and meet during the event.

#### Profile

A buddy is a member of the open science neuroimaging community who:
-   has already attended at least one brain hackathon (e.g. Brainhack, Brainhack school, Neurohackademy, etc.),
-   is familiar with the format of the OHBM Brainhack and in particular with the two tracks (Hacktrack and Traintrack),
-   feels comfortable welcoming new members of the community, listening to their experience, questions and sharing information
as needed.

#### Expectations

1.  Help develop and maintain a welcoming environment at the OHBM Brainhack.
2.  If possible, have a pre-Brainhack meeting with your paired attendee.
3.  During the Brainhack, meet twice with the attendee you have been paired with to
    1. hear about their experience,
    2. get feedback on the event,
    3. provide any input they would like.
4. Communicate feedback or any identified issues with hub leads as needed.

#### Estimated time

Maximum 1 hour before Brainhack and 30 minutes to 1 hour per day during Brainhack.
