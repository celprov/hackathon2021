# Break lead team: role description

The [OHBM Brainhack 2021](https://ohbm.github.io/hackathon2021/) will gather researchers throughout
the world for an online hackathon June 16-18, organized around two main time slots (1AM-6AM UTC and 2PM-7PM UTC). 

The **break lead team** play an essential role in designing the social breaks that will happen during the hackathon.

**Short description**
*Would you like to share your ideas and help designing Brainhack social breaks? Sign up as a break
lead! You will be part of a global team in charge of designing interactive and inclusive break times
for the OHBM Brainhack.*

**Description**
The break lead is in charge of designing how the social break will happen.

A break lead is a member of the open science neuroimaging community who:
-   is passionate about building more interactive online interactions
-   is a team member

**Expectations**
1. Help develop and maintain a welcoming environment at the OHBM Brainhack
2. In collaboration with the Brainhack team, design how the break time included in the schedule will
be organized.
3. Think of ideas that promote interaction, and how we can use other platforms like [Mozilla Hubs](https://hubs.mozilla.com/#/) and ideas like virtual coffee/pizza to make the Brainhack experience awesome, including icebreaker
“gimmicks” e.g. “show us your mug!”
4. Propose resources to make those break time happen (e.g. use Zoom to assign attendees in breakout
rooms of 5-8 people with a ‘breakout room host’ in each room)
6. Work with the Brainhack team to implement those ideas.

**Estimated time**: variable workload between 5-10 hours before Brainhack.
