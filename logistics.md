<h5 style="padding-top: 100px"><b>Time zones and hubs</b></h5>

{% accordion hackathonHubs %}

{% collapse Why have decided to have several hubs? %}
A global online event has to find a good way to compromise on several things.

1. We have to make sure that attendees can join without completely messing up their biological rhythm.
2. We need to have the live broadcast of the event (kick off, pitches, wrap up, coffee/lunch room)
3.    and the TrainTrack happen when attendees are actually awake.

The general idea is to have several places (hubs) that participate in the same global Brainhack, allowing us to partly tackle
the question of geographical inclusivity by allowing people to easily attend no matter where they are.

Each hub follows the same internal structure with respect to platforms used for communication and volunteer roles.

{% endcollapse %}

{% collapse What are the hubs? %}
In addition to this event being the first ever virtual OHBM brainhack, it will also be happening three
times within a 24 hour window, across multiple time-zones. The goal here is to ensure that more people
from around the world are able to join in during reasonable working hours for them.
* Americas Hub
* Europe, Middle East, and Africa Hub
* Asia and Pacific Hub
{% endcollapse %}

{% collapse Hub structure and general organization %}

The event is decentralized across several "hubs" that span a set of time-zones.
In order for the event to run as smoothly as possible across all hubs, each hub will follow the same general schedule
and have various volunteer roles who help with the event.
Some of the roles are selected by the OHBM Open-Science Special Interest Group (OSSIG) while others
are open to volunteers.


<h6 style="padding-top: 50px">Selected by the OS-SIG</h6>

{% collapse brainhack hub hosts %}
Each hub has two brainhack hosts who welcome the participants during the kickoff and project pitches,
moderate the unconferences, and liase with the other volunteers.
{% endcollapse %}

{% collapse Hub manager %}
The hub manager makes sure that everything is running smoothly in the background!
{% endcollapse %}

{% collapse TrainTrack instructors %}
Each TrainTrack session has an instructor, and there will be teaching assistants available for answering questions
while a TrainTrack session is being presented.
{% endcollapse %}

{% collapse Youtube master %}
The Youtube master ensures that all content is streamed to different platforms.
{% endcollapse %}


<h6 style="padding-top: 50px">Open to volunteers</h6>

<h5 style="padding-top: 80px"><b>HackTrack</b></h5>

{% accordion HackTrack %}

<p style="font-size: 18px">
As with previous OHBM hackathons, we've developed a project template that we would like project leads
to use for submitting their project proposals.
</p>

{% collapse Project submission %}
Each project is allocated to a project monitor who will follow the project from submission until the
end of the brainhack.
To make sure that project monitors have enough time to review project submissions, we will be closing projects
submission before the event starts.

<!-- we're setting two
deadlines:
- 2 weeks before the brainhack: submit a draft for project monitors to give feedback on
- 1 week before brainhack: hard deadline -->

[**Project checklist**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SY-Hnhc-bPX0RA47icVukUVVJ-BrX9ykPFQUBY-U1go/edit?usp=sharing):
this is a spreadsheet to help the project helpers making sure that each project is on track and submitted everything.

[**Github issue template**](https://github.com/ohbm/hackathon2020/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/hackathon-project-template.md):
This will be the way to submit brainhack projects. It comes with a checklist to make sure that project
leaders and participants can start in the best conditions.

Once a project has been submitted the project helper can tag it using issue labels to make it easier to search amongst the different projects.
{% endcollapse %}

<h5 style="padding-top: 80px"><b>TrainTrack</b></h5>

<p style="font-size: 18px">
The TrainTrack will cover topics ranging from good code practices, code and data version control,
high performance computing, data visualization, and machine learning. Each session will have its own
computing requirements, but at a baseline, we strongly recommend that participants make sure that
they have the following general computing requirements satisfied in order to be able to follow along with the sessions
on their own devices.
We will have a virtual help desk available to help participants with installation issues.
</p>

{% accordion TrainTrack %}

{% collapse General computing requirements %}
In addition to some software that we will list in the subsequent section, these are the general computing
requirements:
- Administrative access to your computer such that you can install software on your own.
- If you're using Windows, the required version is the 64 bit version of Windows 10. Please contact
  us if you don't have either MacOS, Linux, or a Windows 10 64-bit machine.
{% endcollapse %}

{% collapse Required software %}
Along with the platforms that we will be using for virtual TrainTrack presentations and communication,
we ask that you install the following software.
* Mattermost (can be used in the browser as well)
* A modern browser (for using Crowdcast and Jitsi)
* Zoom
* A command-line shell: Bash
* A version control system: Git
* A GitHub account

<h5 style="padding-top: 80px"><b>OS-specific installation instructions</b></h5>

{% accordion os_specific_installation_instructions %}
Thank you to Ross Markello and the rest of the Montreal Brainhack School 2020 team for creating these very detailed setup instructions!

{% collapse Linux %}
###### **Bash shell**

All Ubuntu and other Linux distros come with Bash as the default shell, so no need to download it!
Some versions of Linux may require that you type bash inside the terminal to access it. To verify if this is the case, follow
these steps:

Open a terminal and type `echo $SHELL`. If it reads `/bin/bash` then you are all set! If it does not,
then for all parts of the subsequent instructions, whenever the instructions read “open a terminal,”
please assume you are to open a terminal, type bash, and the proceed with the instructions as specified.

###### **Git**

You most likely already have Git installed.
To check if you do:
- On Debian -  type `sudo apt-get install git` inside the terminal
- On Fedora - type `sudo yum install git` inside the terminal.

###### **VSCode**
Go to the [visual studio code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and click the download button for either the .deb (Ubuntu, Debian) or the .rpm (Fedora, CentOS) file.

Double-click the downloaded file to install VSCode. (You may be prompted to type your administrator password during the install).

###### **VSCode extensions**

Select the appropriate entry from the dropdown menu that appears (there should be four entries; simply select the one that reads “Extensions: Install extensions”).
4. A new panel should appear on the left-hand side of the screen with a search bar. Search for each of the following extensions and press `Install` for the first entry that appears. (The author listed for all of these extensions should be “Microsoft”.)
- Python (n.b., you will need to reload VSCode after installing this)
- Live Share (n.b., you may need to press “Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P” and type “install extensions” again after installing this)
- Live Share Extension Pack
- Docker
- Remote - WSL

###### **Python**

1. Open a new terminal and type the following lines (separately) into the terminal, pressing `Enter` after each one:

   ``` bash

###### **Datalad**

Please see the [Datalad handbook](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/intro/installation.html).

###### **Docker**

Unfortunately, Docker for Windows is a bit of a mess.
The recommended version of Docker to install varies dramatically depending not only on which version of Windows you have installed (e.g., Windows 10 Home versus Professional/Enterprise/Education), but also which _build_ of Windows you have.
As such, developing a comprehensive set of instructions for installing Docker is rather difficult.

Having said that, if you're lucky enough to have Windows 10 Professional/Enterprise/Education (i.e. it is _not_ Windows 10 Home), and you don't use VirtualBox (or if you don't know what VirtualBox is), then you can download and install [Docker for Windows Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/). Follow the instructions at that link.

If you are using Windows 10 Home, or any other version of Windows, then the best option may be to install [Docker Toolbox for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/).

Instructions for installing Docker Toolbox for Windows:

1. Download the latest [Docker Toolbox installer](https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases/download/v19.03.1/DockerToolbox-19.03.1.exe) (note: that link will automatically download the file)
1. Run the downloaded `.exe` file and leave all the defaults during the installation procedure.
   Click `Yes`on the prompt that appears asking if the application can make changes to your computer.
1. Search for and open the newly-installed "Docker Quickstart" application.
   Again, click `Yes`on the prompt that appears asking if the application can make changes to your computer.
   The application will do a number of things to finish installing and setting up Docker.
1. Once you see a `$` prompt type `docker run hello-world`.
   A brief introductory message should be printed to the screen.
1. Close the "Docker Quickstart" application and open a terminal (i.e., the Ubuntu application).
1. Copy-paste the following commands.
   You will be prompted to enter your password once.

   ``` bash
   # Update the apt package list.
   sudo apt-get update -y
   # Install Docker's package dependencies.
   sudo apt-get install -y \
       apt-transport-https \
       ca-certificates \
       curl \
       software-properties-common
   # Download and add Docker's official public PGP key.
   curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
   # Verify the fingerprint.
   sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
   # Add the `stable` channel's Docker upstream repository.
   sudo add-apt-repository \
       "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
       $(lsb_release -cs) \
       stable"
   # Update the apt package list (for the new apt repo).
   sudo apt-get update -y
   # Install the latest version of Docker CE.
   sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce
   # Allow your user to access the Docker CLI without needing root access.
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```

1. Close and re-open the terminal.
1. Type `pip install docker-compose`.
1. Type `powershell.exe "docker-machine config"`.
   You should get output similar to the following:

   ``` bash
   --tlsverify
   --tlscacert="C:\\Users\\<YOUR_USERNAME>\\.docker\\machine\\machines\\default\\ca.pem"
   --tlscert="C:\\Users\\<YOUR_USERNAME>\\.docker\\machine\\machines\\default\\cert.pem"
   --tlskey="C:\\Users\\<YOUR_USERNAME>\\.docker\\machine\\machines\\default\\key.pem"
   -H=tcp://xxx.xxx.xx.xxx:xxxx
   ```

   where `<YOUR_USERNAME>` will have an actual value (likely your Windows username), and `tcp=xxx.xxx.xx.xxx:xxx` will be a series of numbers.
   If you don't get this output then something has gone wrong.
   Please make sure you were able to run the `docker run hello-world` command, above.
   If you were and you still don't receive this output, please contact one of the instructors on the #help-installation channel on the BHS Slack.
1. You will use the the outputs of the above command to modify the commands below before running them in the terminal.
   First, take the numbers printed in place of the `x`s on the output of the line `-H=tcp://xxx.xxx.xx.xxx:xxxx` from above and replace the placeholder `xxx.xxx.xx.xxx:xxxx` on the first command below (`export DOCKER_HOST`).
   Second, take whatever value is printed in place of `<YOUR_USERNAME>` above and replace the `<YOUR_USERNAME>` placeholder on the second command below (`export DOCKER_CERT_PATH`).
   Once you have updated the commands appropriately, copy and paste them into the terminal:

   ```bash
   echo "export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://xxx.xxx.xx.xxx:xxxx" >> $HOME/.bashrc
   echo "export DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/mnt/c/Users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/.docker/machine/certs" >> $HOME/.bashrc
   echo "export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1" >> $HOME/.bashrc
   ```

1. Close and re-open a terminal (i.e., the Ubuntu application).
   Type `docker run hello-world`.
   The same brief introductory message you saw before should be printed to the screen.

**Note**: If you restart your computer (or somehow otherwise shut down the Docker VM) you will need to re-open the "Docker Quickstart" application and wait until you see the `$` prompt again before your `docker` commands will work again!
If you are having problems running `docker` commands in the terminal, try re-opening the "Docker Quickstart" application.
